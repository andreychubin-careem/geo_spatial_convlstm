Convolutional LSTM for geo spatial forecasting based on Next Frame Prediction approach (Encoder/Decoder based)

Includes:
- ~~ConvLSTM (Not included in Pytorch Lightning Wrapper)~~
- ~~ConvGRU (Not included in Pytorch Lightning Wrapper)~~
- ConvTTLSTM (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09131.pdf)

!!! This code has some MPS-specific parts that need to be changed to run model training on CPU or GPU
