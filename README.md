Convolutional LSTM for geo spatial forecasting based on Next Frame Prediction approach (Encoder/Decoder based)

Includes:
- ConvLSTM (Not included in Pytorch Lightning Wrapper)
- ConvGRU (Not included in Pytorch Lightning Wrapper)
- ConvTTLSTM

!!! This code has some MPS-specific parts that need to be changed to run model training on CPU or GPU
